3</span>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smcap">off for greenock</span>.</h2>
<p>The late&mdash;I had almost written the last&mdash;Imperial
ruler of France was wont to say&mdash;indeed, it was his
favourite maxim&mdash;&ldquo;Everything comes to him who
waits.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not exactly true in his case.&nbsp;
Just as he was to have placed himself at the head of his
followers, and make his reappearance in France, and to have
effaced the recollections of Sedan, Death, who waits for no one,
who comes at the appointed time to all, put a stop to his
career.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the saying is more or less true, and
especially as regards my appearance on board the
<i>Elena</i>.&nbsp; Whether my great great grandfather was a
Viking or no, I am unable to say; all I know is, from my youth
upwards I have longed for a yacht in which I could cruise at my
own sweet will.&nbsp; I am no great hand at singing, but when I
do sing it is always of a</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Life on the ocean wave,<br />
A home on the rolling deep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>And thus it happened that, when an invitation was sent to
me, just as I was on the point of giving up the ghost, in
consequence of the heat of a London summer, to leave Fleet
Street, and cruise among the Western Islands of Scotland, I
accepted it, as the reader may well suppose, at once.</p>
<p>It is somewhat of a journey by the Midland night express from
London to Greenock; but the journey is one well worth taking,
even if, as in my case, you do not get a Pullman car, as that had
been already filled, and was booked full, so the ticket manager
said, for at any rate twelve days in advance.&nbsp; It is really
interesting to see that express start.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is an
uncommon fine sight,&rdquo; said a man to me the other night, as
he lit his pipe at the St. Pancras Station.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always
come here when I&rsquo;ve done work; it is cheaper than a
public-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it is, and far better in
awakening the intellect or stimulating the life.&nbsp; It is true
I did not see the express start, as I happened to be in it; but I
had another and a greater pleasure&mdash;that of being whirled
along the country, from one great city or hive of industry to
another, till I found myself early in the morning looking down
from <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>the heights of Greenock on the busy Clyde below.&nbsp; It
was a grand panorama, not easily to be forgotten.&nbsp; All at
once it opens on you, and you enjoy the view all the more as it
comes in so unexpected a manner.</p>
<p>Let me pause, and say a good word for the line that bears me
swiftly and safely and pleasantly on.</p>
<p>The story of railway enterprise as connected with the Midland
Railway has been told in a very bulky volume by Mr. J.
Williams.&nbsp; I learn from it that forty years have elapsed
since, originating in the necessity of a few coal-owners, it has
gradually stretched out its iron arms till its ramifications are
to be found in all parts of the land.&nbsp; Actually, up to the
present time it has involved an expenditure of fifty millions,
and its annual revenue reaches five.&nbsp; Daily&mdash;hourly, it
rushes, with its heavy load of tourists, or holiday-makers, or
men of business, past the ancient manor-houses of Wingfield,
Haddon, and Rousbery; the abbeys of St. Albans, Leicester,
Newstead, Kirkstall, Beauchief, and Evesham; the castles of
Someries, Skipton, Sandal, Berkeley, Tamworth, Hay, Clifford,
Codnor, Ashby, Nottingham, Leicester, Lincoln, and Newark; the
battle-fields of St. <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Albans, Bosworth, Wakefield,
Tewkesbury, and Evesham.</p>
<p>But it is to that part of the line between Carlisle and Settle
that I would more particularly refer&mdash;that boon to the
southern tourist who, as the writer did, takes his seat in a
Midland carriage at St. Pancras, and finds himself, without a
change of carriage, the next morning at Greenock in time for the
far-famed breakfasts on board the <i>Iona</i>.&nbsp; The ordinary
traveller has no idea of the difficulties which at one time lay
between him and his journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
very rare thing,&rdquo; once said Mr. Allport, the great Midland
Railway manager, a name honoured everywhere, &ldquo;for me to go
down to Carlisle without being turned out twice.&nbsp; Then,
although some of the largest towns in England are upon the
Midland system, there is no through carriage to Edinburgh, unless
we occasionally have a family going down, and then we make an
especial arrangement, and apply for a special carriage to go
through.&nbsp; We have applied in vain for through carriages to
Scotland over and over again.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the Midland had
no alternative but to have a line of their own.&nbsp; When it was
known at Appleby that their Bill had passed the Commons, <!--
page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the
church bells were rung, and, as was quaintly remarked, the people
wrote to the newspapers, and did all that was proper under the
circumstances.&nbsp; No wonder Appleby rejoiced and was glad;
for, though the county town of Westmoreland, it is not much of a
place after all, and the railway must have been a boon to the
natives&mdash;especially to the ladies, who otherwise, it is to
be feared, would have wasted their sweetness on the desert
air.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 2nd of August, 1875, after an expenditure of
three millions, the Settle and Carlisle line was opened for goods
traffic.&nbsp; It must have been an awful undertaking, the making
of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; said a rhetorical farmer,
&ldquo;there is not a level piece of ground big enough to build a
house upon all the way between Settle and Carlisle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
An ascent had to be made to a height of more than a thousand feet
above the level of the sea, by an incline that should be easy
enough for the swiftest passenger expresses and for the heaviest
mineral trains to pass securely and punctually up and down, not
only in the light days of summer, but in the darkest and
&ldquo;greasiest&rdquo; December nights.&nbsp; To construct it
the men had to cut the boulder clay&mdash;very unpleasant <!--
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>stuff to deal with&mdash;to hew through granite, to build
on morasses and dismal swamps.&nbsp; Near the southernmost end of
the valley, watered by the roaring Ribble, the town of Settle
stands among wooded hills, overhung by a lofty limestone rock
called Castlebar; while far beyond on the left and right rise,
above the sea of mountains, the mighty outlines of Whernside and
Pennegent, often hid in the dark clouds of trailing mists.&nbsp;
Up the valley the new line runs, pursuing its way among perhaps
the loneliest dales, the wildest mountain wastes, and the
scantiest population of any part of England.&nbsp; Three miles
from Settle we reach Stainforth Force, and just beyond are the
remains of a Roman camp.&nbsp; At Batty Green the navvies
declared that they were in one of the wildest, windiest, coldest,
and dreariest localities in the world.&nbsp; In the old coaching
days the journey across these wilds was most disagreeable and
trying.&nbsp; It was no unusual thing, we read, for rain to come
down upon the travellers in torrents; for snow to fall in
darkened flakes or driving showers of powdered ice; for winds to
blow and howl with hurricane force, bewildering to man and beast;
for frost to bite and benumb both hands and face till feeling was
almost gone; and <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>for hail and sleet to blind the
traveller&rsquo;s eyes and to make his face smart as if beaten
with a myriad of slender cords.&nbsp; In Dent Dale, which is
almost ten miles in length, the scenery is remarkably fine.&nbsp;
Nearly five hundred feet below, now sparkling in the sunlight,
now losing itself among some clusters of trees, winds the river
Dee; while first on one side and then on the other is the road
that leads to Sedbergh.&nbsp; Leaving the tunnel, we find
ourselves in Garsdale, in a milder clime and amidst more
attractive scenery.&nbsp; Some four hundred feet below us the
river may be observed winding over its rocky bed in the direction
of Sedbergh, while we get extensive views on the west.&nbsp;
Presently we see the Moorside Inn, a far-famed hostelry abounding
in mountain dew, standing at the head of the valleys&mdash;the
Wensleydale, winding eastward towards Hawes; the Garsdale Valley,
going westward towards Sedbergh; and the Mallerstang, leading
northwards towards Kirkby Stephen.</p>
<p>At Ais Gill Moor the line attains its highest altitude, 1,167
feet above the sea, from whence it falls uninterruptedly down to
Carlisle.&nbsp; The country here is very wild and rugged.&nbsp;
Stone walls mark the division of the properties, and <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>scarcely any house can be seen.&nbsp; On the west the
grandly impressive form of Wild Boar Fell rises.&nbsp; Still
higher on the east is Mallerstang Edge.&nbsp; In the winter you
can well believe that along this valley sweeps the wind in bitter
blasts.&nbsp; Three miles after we have left the Moor Loch we are
in Cumberland, and are reminded of other days when all the old
manor-houses and other edifices were built for defence against
the invasions of the Picts.&nbsp; Though the upper part of the
Eden valley is now occupied by a few industrious farmers and
peaceful shepherds, we instinctively think of the time when the
slogan of border chiefs and their clansmen sent a thrill of
terror through Mallerstang, and when sword and fire did terrible
work to man and beast.&nbsp; Here is Wild Boar Fell, where, says
tradition, the last wild boar was killed by one of the Musgrave
family; and there in a narrow dale, overlooked by mountains and
washed by the Eden, are the crumbling ruins of a square
tower&mdash;all, alas! that remains of Pendragon Castle.&nbsp;
About a mile before we come to Kirkby Stephen we pass on our
right Wharton Hall, the seat of the now extinct dukes of that
name.&nbsp; Near the town are two objects of especial
interest&mdash;the <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Ewbank Scar and Stenkrith
Falls.&nbsp; The sight from Ormside Viaduct is wonderfully
fine.&nbsp; Appleby, as seen from the line, has a very pleasing
appearance.&nbsp; The railway runs past Eden Hall, the residence
of Sir Richard Musgrave, the chief of the clan of that
name.&nbsp; At the summit of a hill, near the Eden Lacy Viaduct,
we find the remains of a Druid&rsquo;s temple, known by the name
of &ldquo;Long Meg and her Daughters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close by is
Lazonby, a village in the midst of interesting historical
associations.&nbsp; As we pass through the ancient forest, we
would fain stop and linger, as the scenery about here is deeply
romantic, as much so as that of Derbyshire.&nbsp; At Armathwaite
the beauty of the district culminates; and we gaze with rapture
at its ancient quaint square castle, its picturesque viaduct of
nine arches eighty feet high, its road bridge of freestone, its
cataract, and its elm&mdash;said to be the finest in
Cumberland.&nbsp; At Carlisle there is a fine railway hotel,
which you enter by a side door from the platform, and where the
traveller may attain such refreshment as he requires.&nbsp;
Indeed, it is open to the public on the same reasonable terms as
the London Tavern when it was the head-quarters of aldermanic
turtle.&nbsp; The town <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>is delightfully clean, and has many
interesting associations; and as I stood upon the ramparts of the
castle there on my return, smoking a cigar, there came to me
memories of William Rufus, who built the wall, and planted in the
town the industrious Flemings; of King David of Scotland; of
Wallace, the Scottish hero, who quartered his troops there; of
Cromwell, &ldquo;our chief of men,&rdquo; as Milton calls him;
and of the Pretenders, father and son.&nbsp; It is with interest
I look at the church of St. Mary, remembering, as I do, that it
was there Sir Walter Scott was married.&nbsp; I am told the
interior of the cathedral is very beautiful, and crowded with
memorials of a truly interesting character.&nbsp; Externally the
place looks in good condition, as it was repaired as lately as
1853&ndash;6.&nbsp; Altogether the town appears comfortable, as
it ought to do, considering it has extensive founderies and
breweries, manufactories of woollen, linen, cotton, and other
fabrics; communication with six lines of railway; a canal, two
rivers, and two local newspapers.&nbsp; Nor is Carlisle
ungrateful.&nbsp; I find in its market-place a statue to Lord
Lonsdale, who has much property in these parts.&nbsp; One can
tarry there long.&nbsp; Afar off you see the hills of the Lake
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Country&mdash;the country of Southey and
Wordsworth&mdash;and, if you but keep your seat, in an hour or
two you may be, according to your taste, &ldquo;touring it&rdquo;
in the land of Burns, or in the district immortalised by the
genius of Sir Walter Scott.</p>
<p>As I went one way, and returned another, I enjoyed this
privilege and pleasure.&nbsp; At Dumfries I could not but
recollect that there the poet Burns wrote his</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Scots wha hae wi&rsquo; Wallace
bled;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that there he died prematurely worn-out in 1796; that there,
as he lay dying, the whole town was convulsed with grief; and
that there his funeral was attended by some ten or twelve
thousand of the people whose hearts he had touched, and who loved
him, in spite of his errors, to the end.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dumfries,&rdquo; wrote Allan Cunningham, &ldquo;was like a
besieged place.&nbsp; It was known he was dying, and the anxiety,
not of the rich and learned, but of the mechanics and peasants,
exceeded all belief.&nbsp; Wherever two or three people stood
together, their talk was of Burns, and him alone.&nbsp; They
spoke of his history, of his person, of his works, of his family,
and of his untimely and approaching fate, with a warmth <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and
enthusiasm which will ever endear Dumfries to my
remembrance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thinking of Burns, the time passed
pleasantly, as I mused, half awake and half dreaming, that early
summer morning, till I reached Greenock, where sleeps that
Highland Mary, who died during their courtship, and of whom Burns
wrote, in lines that will last as long as love, and woman, and
the grave&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ah! pale&mdash;pale now those rosy lips<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I aft hae kissed sae fondly;<br />
And closed for aye the sparkling glance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That dwelt on me sae kindly.<br />
And mouldering now in silent dust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That heart that loved me dearly;<br />
But still within my bosom&rsquo;s core<br />
&nbsp; Shall live my Highland Mary.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smcap">from greenock to ardrossan</span>.</h2>
<p>I shall never forget my first view of the Clyde from the
heights above Greenock.&nbsp; It is true I had seen the Clyde
before, but it was at Glasgow years ago, and it had left on my
mind but a poor impression of its extent, or utility, or
grandeur.&nbsp; What a sight you have of dockyards, where
thousands of men are ship-building! and what a fleet of vessels
laden with the produce of every country under heaven!&nbsp; As I
take up a Scotch paper, I read:&mdash;&ldquo;The cargoes imported
during the month included 64 of grain, &amp;c., 65 of sugar, 22
of timber, 5 of wine, 2 of fruits, 1 of brandy, 1 of ice, 3 of
esparto grass and iron ore, 3 of rosin, 2 of oil, 1 of tar, 1 of
guano, 1 of nitrate of soda, and 4 with minerals.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then how grand is the prospect beyond&mdash;of distant
watering-places, crammed during the summer season, not alone with
Glasgow and Edinburgh citizens, <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>but with
English tourists, who find in these picturesque spots a charm
they can discover nowhere else.&nbsp; Almost all the way&mdash;at
any rate, since I left Leeds&mdash;I have had my carriage almost
entirely to myself; and now I am in a crowd greater and busier
than of Cheapside at noon, with knapsacks and carpet-bags and
umbrellas, all bent on seeing those beauties of Nature of which
Scotland may well be proud.</p>
<p>To leave the train and hurry down the pier, and rush on board
the <i>Iona</i>, is the work of a minute, but of a minute rich in
marvels.&nbsp; The <i>Iona</i> is a fine saloon steamer, which
waits for the train at Greenock, and thence careers along the
Western Coast, leaving her passengers at various ports, and
picking up others till some place or other, with a name which I
can hardly pronounce, and certainly cannot spell, is
reached.&nbsp; It must carry some fourteen or fifteen hundred
people.&nbsp; I should think we had quite that number on
board&mdash;people like myself, who had been travelling all
night&mdash;people who had joined us at such places as Leicester,
or Leeds, or Carlisle&mdash;people who had come all the way in
her from Glasgow&mdash;people who had come on
business&mdash;people who were bent on pleasure&mdash;<!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>people who had never visited the Highlands
before&mdash;people who are as familiar with them as I am with
Cheapside or the Strand&mdash;people with every variety of
costume, of both sexes and of all ages&mdash;people who differed
on all subjects, but who agreed in this one faith, that to
breakfast on board the <i>Iona</i> is one of the first duties of
man, and one of the noblest of woman&rsquo;s rights.&nbsp; Oh,
that breakfast!&nbsp; To do it justice requires an abler pen than
mine.&nbsp; Never did I part with a florin&mdash;the sum charged
for breakfast&mdash;with greater pleasure.&nbsp; We all know
breakfasts are one of those things they manage well in Scotland,
and the breakfast on board the <i>Iona</i> is the latest and most
triumphant vindication of the fact.&nbsp; Cutlets of salmon fresh
from the water, sausages of a tenderness and delicacy of which
the benighted cockney who fills his paunch with the flabby and
plethoric article sold under that title by the provision dealer
can have no idea; coffee hot and aromatic, and suggestive of
Araby the blest; marmalades of all kinds, with bread-and-butter
and toast, all equally good, and served up by the cleanest and
most civil of stewards.&nbsp; Sure never had any mother&rsquo;s
son ever such a breakfast before.&nbsp; It was with something of
regret that I <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>left it, and that handsome saloon
filled with happy faces and rejoicing hearts.</p>
<p>In about half-an-hour after leaving Greenock, I was at Kirn, a
beautiful watering-place in Argyleshire, in one of the handsomest
villas of which I was to find my host, and the owner of the
<i>Elena</i>, one of the finest of the four or five hundred
yachts which grace the lake-like waters of the Clyde, and which
carry the ensign of the Royal Clyde Yacht Club.&nbsp; A volume
might be written of the owner, whose place of business in Glasgow
is one of the real wonders of that ancient town.&nbsp; Morrison,
the founder of the Fore Street Warehouse, and the father of the
late M.P. for Plymouth, was accustomed to say that he owed all
his success in life to the realisation of the fact that the great
art of mercantile traffic was to find out sellers rather than
buyers; that if you bought cheap and satisfied yourself with a
fair profit, buyers&mdash;the best sort of buyers, those who have
money to buy with&mdash;would come of themselves.&nbsp; It is on
this principle the owner of the <i>Elena</i> has acted.&nbsp; It
is worth something to see the S&egrave;vres china, the fine oil
paintings, the spoils of such palaces as the Louvre or St. Cloud,
the rarest ornaments of such exhibitions as those of <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Vienna, all gathered together in the Glasgow
Polytechnic, and to seek which the proprietor is always on the
look-out, and to recollect that all this display has been got
together by one individual, who began the world in a much smaller
way, and who is still in the prime of life.&nbsp; A further
interest attaches to the gentleman of whom I write, inasmuch as
it was under his roof that the first article of the <i>Christian
Cabinet</i>, swallowed up in the <i>Christian World</i>, was
written.&nbsp; It may be to this it is due that at once I am at
home with him, and that here on board the <i>Elena</i> we chat of
what goes on in London as if we had known each other all our
lives.&nbsp; By my side is his son-in-law&mdash;one of those
well-trained, thoughtful divines who have left Scotland for the
South, and who are doing so much to introduce into England that
Presbyterianism the yoke of which our fathers could not bear, but
on which we, their more liberal sons, have learned to look with a
less jealous eye; and no wonder, for to know such a man as the
Doctor is to love him.&nbsp; And now let me say a word as to the
<i>Elena</i>, which is a picture to admire, as she floats calmly
on the water, or speeds her way from one scene of Scottish story
and romance to another.&nbsp; It is <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>rarely one
sees a yacht more tastefully fitted-up, and we have a
ladies&rsquo; drawing-room on board not unworthy of Belgravia
itself.&nbsp; She is slightly rakish in build, but not
disagreeably so.&nbsp; Her tonnage is 200 tons, and her crew
consists, including the stoker and steward, of some eight
clever-looking, sailor-like men.&nbsp; As we sleep on board I am
glad of this.&nbsp; With Gonsalo I exclaim, &ldquo;The wills
above be done; but I had rather die a dry death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, after skirting the greater and the lesser Cumbraes,
and the cave where Bruce hid himself, &amp;c., &amp;c., we are
coaling off Ardrossan, apparently a busy town on the Ayrshire
coast.&nbsp; I have been on shore, and have seen no end of coal
and lumber ships in the docks, and in the streets are many shops
with all the latest novelties from town, and with ladies lounging
in and out.&nbsp; I know I am in Scotland, as I hear the bagpipes
droning in the distance, and stop to judge the beef and mutton
exposed for sale at the shop of the nearest
&ldquo;flesher.&rdquo;&nbsp; On a hill behind me is a monument
which, the natives inform me, is in memory of Dr. Mac-something,
of whom I never heard, and respecting whom no one apparently can
tell me anything.&nbsp; I know <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>further I am
in Scotland, as I see everywhere Presbyterian places of worship,
and hear accents not familiar to an English ear.&nbsp; I know
also I am in Scotland, as I see no gaudy public-house with
superfine young ladies to attract my weak-kneed brethren to the
bar, but instead dull and dark houses, in which only sots would
care to go.&nbsp; I know I am in Scotland, because it is only
there I read of &ldquo;self-contained houses&rdquo; to let or
sell; and as to Ardrossan in particular, let me say that it is
much frequented by the Glasgow merchants in the season; that it,
with its neighbour Saltcoats, supports a <i>Herald</i>, published
weekly for a penny; that from it, as a local poet
writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We
see bold Arran&rsquo;s mountains gray,<br />
In dark sublimity, stand forth in grandeur day by day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet speaks truly.&nbsp; As I write I see the heights of
the Scottish Alps, whose feet are fringed with the white villas
of the Glasgow merchants for miles, and washed by the romantic
waters of the Clyde.</p>
<p>Anciently Ardrossan was a hamlet of miserable huts, says Mr.
Murray&mdash;Mr. Thomas, of Glasgow, not Mr. John, of
London&mdash;gathered around an old castle on Castle Hill, the
scene of <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>some of Wallace&rsquo;s daring
achievements, and destroyed by Cromwell.&nbsp; It was said to
have belonged to a warlock, known as the Deil of Ardrossan.&nbsp;
The present town was originated in 1806 as a seaport for Glasgow,
but, like Port Glasgow, proved a failure in this respect.&nbsp;
It is, however, generally well filled with shipping.&nbsp; The
Pavilion, a residence of the Earl of Eglinton, adjoins the
town.&nbsp; Steamers run thence to Belfast and Newry, and to Ayr
and Arran and Glasgow.</p>
<p>Let me here remark, as indicating the cultivated character of
the Scotchman, one is surprised at the number of local papers one
sees in all the Scotch towns.&nbsp; They are mostly well written,
and have a London Correspondent.&nbsp; It is beautiful to find
how in the Scotch towns there is still faith left in the London
Correspondent.&nbsp; The people swallow him as they do the
Greater and Lesser Catechism, and even the London papers quote
him as with happy audacity he describes the dissensions in the
Cabinet&mdash;the hopes and fears of Earl Beaconsfield, the
secret purposes of the garrulous Lord Derby, or the too amiable
and communicative Marquis of Salisbury.&nbsp; When yachting I
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>made a point to buy every Scotch paper I could, for the
express purpose of reading what Our London Correspondent had got
to say.&nbsp; I was both amused and edified.&nbsp; It is said you
must go from home to hear the news.&nbsp; I realised that in
Scotland as I had never done before.&nbsp; On the dull, wet days,
when travelling was out of the question, what a boon was our
&ldquo;Own Special London Correspondent!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<span class="smcap">a sunday at oban</span>.</h2>
<p>Taking advantage of a fine day, we left Ardrossan, with its
coal and timber ships, early one Saturday, and were soon tossing
up and down that troubled spot known as the Mull of
Kintyre.&nbsp; It was a glorious sight, and one rarely enjoyed by
tourists, who make a short cut across a canal, and lose a great
deal in the way of beautiful effects of earth, and sea, and
sky.&nbsp; On our left was the Irish coast, here but fifteen
miles across, and far behind were the dark forms of the mountains
of Arran.&nbsp; Islay, famed for its whisky in modern and for its
romantic history in ancient times, next rises out of the
waters.&nbsp; Jura, with its three Paps, as its hills are called,
comes next, and then, in the narrow sound between Jura and
Scarba, there is the terrible whirlpool of Corrybrechan, the
noise and commotion of whose whirling waves are often, writes the
local Guide-book, audible from <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the
steamer.&nbsp; The tradition is, as referred to in
Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gertrude of Wyoming,&rdquo; that there a
Danish prince, who was foolhardy enough to cast anchor in it,
lost his life.&nbsp; To-day it is silent and at rest, and it
requires some stretch of imagination to believe, as the poet
tells us, that &ldquo;on the shores of Argyleshire I have often
listened with delight to the sound of the vortex at the distance
of many leagues.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length we reach Scarba, Mull is
swiftly gained, and there, on the other side of us, not, however,
to be visited now, are Staffa and Iona.&nbsp; Altogether, we seem
in a deserted district.&nbsp; It is only now and then we see a
house, or gentleman&rsquo;s residence, and, except where we pass
some slate works on our right, the rocks and hills around seem
utterly unutilised.&nbsp; Occasionally we see a few sheep or
cattle feeding, and once or twice we are cheered with arable
land, and crops growing on it; but the rule is to leave Nature
pretty much to herself.&nbsp; It is the same on the water.&nbsp;
We on board the fairy <i>Elena</i>, and the gulls following in
our wake, are almost entirely monarchs of all we survey.&nbsp; On
we glide up the Frith of Lorne, which seems to narrow as we come
near to Kerrera, which has on its lofty sea-cliff the ancient
Castle of Glen; and <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>there before us lies Oban, or the
white bay, in all its charms of wood and hill and water.&nbsp;
Oban is a growing place, and we land where the steamer which
brings on the tourists from Iona has just put down its
passengers, amongst whom I see Dr. Charles Mackay, who, in the
evening of his days, much affects this delightful retreat&mdash;a
place, I imagine, quiet enough in winter, but now seemingly the
head-quarters of the human race.&nbsp; There are yachts all
round, but none equalling the <i>Elena</i>.&nbsp; The hotels
which line the bay are handsome, beautifully fitted up, and the
proprietors are looking forward to the 12th of August and the
advent of the English.&nbsp; All the shops are doing a roaring
trade, and as to eggs, not one has been seen in Oban these four
days.&nbsp; Here come the coaches, something of a cross between
omnibuses and wagonettes, which run to Glencoe and Fort William,
and other spots more or less famed in Scottish story; and here is
the band to remind one of watering-places nearer home.&nbsp; I
find here the original Christy&rsquo;s Minstrel (I never thought
of finding him so far North), and the proprietor of an American
bazaar, who tells me that he has been taking his &pound;40 a
night, but who finds himself too well known to the natives, and
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>intimates that he will have to move off shortly; and
last, but not least, a gentleman who modestly enters himself in
the fashionable announcements as Smith, of London!&nbsp; I should
like to see that Smith.&nbsp; I dare say I should know him; but
at present I have not succeeded in running him down.&nbsp; If he
is going to stay long at Oban, it strikes me he should have
plenty of money in his pocket.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t blame the Oban
hotel-keepers.&nbsp; They have a very short summer, and are bound
to make hay while the sun shines; but they do stick it on.&nbsp;
The Doctor tells me of a Scotchman who came to London, and who,
to illustrate the costliness of his visit, remarked to his friend
that he had not been half-an-hour in the place but bang went
sixpence.&nbsp; That economical Scot would find money go quite as
quickly here.&nbsp; At any rate, such are my reflections as I
turn into my little cot after, one by one, the lights in Oban
have been put out, and the last of the pleasure-seekers has
retired to roost.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning I wake to find that it has rained steadily
all night, and that it is raining still.&nbsp; Mrs. Gamp
intimates that life &ldquo;is a wale o&rsquo; tears.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Oban seems to be such emphatically.&nbsp; <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>This is
awkward, as I hear the refined and accomplished lady who shares
with us the perils and the dangers of the deep intimates that in
Scotland people are not expected to laugh on the
Sabbath-day.&nbsp; It rains all breakfast; it rains as we descend
the <i>Elena&rsquo;s</i> side, and are rowed ashore; it rains as
we make our way to the Established Church, in which that popular
minister, the Rev. Mr. Barclay, of Greenock, is to preach.&nbsp;
His sermon is on the death of Moses.&nbsp; He glides lightly over
the subject, telling us that his text, which is Deut. xxxv. 5,
teaches the incompetency of the noblest life, the penal
consequences of sin, the mercy mingled with the Divine judgment,
and the uniformity of God&rsquo;s method of dealing.&nbsp; Mr.
Barclay is listened to with attention.&nbsp; In his black gown,
his tall, dark figure looks well in the pulpit, and there must be
some eight or nine hundred people present.&nbsp; There is a
collection after, but I see no gold coin in the plate, though the
bay is full of yachts, and there must be many wealthy people
there.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, they patronise the small
Episcopalian church close by.&nbsp; After the sermon, we are
rowed back in the heavy rain to the yacht, and &ldquo;it is
regular Highland weather&rdquo; is all the consolation that I
get, as I <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>dry myself in the stoke-hole, while
the Doctor philosophically smokes.</p>
<p>In the evening we are rowed again on shore, and seek out the
Free Church, where Professor Candlish, the son of the far-famed
Doctor of that name, is to preach.&nbsp; He has the reputation of
being a remarkably profound divine, and certainly reputation has
not done him injustice in this respect.&nbsp; His sermon is a
great contrast to that I heard in the morning.&nbsp; It is full
fifty minutes long, and is an argumentative defence of the text,
&ldquo;Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The preacher proposed to
deal with the objection, which he admitted might be fairly made,
that if Jesus paid the debt, our salvation was not a matter of
grace at all; and for this purpose we had line upon line in
thoroughly old Scotch fashion, the hearers all the while looking
out the passages of Scripture referred to in their Bibles.&nbsp;
The sermon was old-fashioned as to thought, but the language was
modern.&nbsp; I was glad I went to hear it.&nbsp; The
congregation was not above half the size of that which appeared
in the Established Church, and a great deal less
fashionable.&nbsp; There you saw a good deal of the tourist
element.&nbsp; <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Here we had the real natives, as it
were; and I must own that I saw more men than I should have seen
in a congregation of the same size at home.&nbsp; At the church
in the morning we had, in addition to the Scotch Psalms, such
hymns as &ldquo;I lay my sins on Jesus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord of
the worlds above.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the evening we had no novelties
of that kind.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole service was dry and severe
to a degenerate Southern.&nbsp; Mr. Barclay quoted a good deal of
Mrs. Alexander&rsquo;s fine poem on the death of Moses.&nbsp;
Professor Candlish did nothing of the kind.&nbsp; His sermon was,
in fact, quite in accordance with the day and the <i>genius
loci</i>.&nbsp; I felt it was such a sermon as I had a right to
expect.&nbsp; As I leave the church, I wonder to myself how the
tourists manage.&nbsp; It is too wet to walk, and if they do take
a walk it is not considered the correct thing in these northern
latitudes, where, to make matters worse, the Sunday is nearly an
hour longer than it is in London.&nbsp; I am afraid, however,
some of the townsfolk find the time hang heavily on their
hands.&nbsp; It seemed to me that there was an unusually large
number of female faces at the window, and when the boat comes to
fetch us on board the <i>Elena</i> all the <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>windows are
full of, I fear, frivolous spectators.&nbsp; It is true that I am
adorned with a genuine Highland bonnet, and would make my fortune
in London as a Guy on the fifth of November; but here Highland
bonnets are common.&nbsp; It is true my companion is a great
divine from town, and one well known in Exeter Hall; but here you
would take him for a skipper, and nautical men are as common as
Highland bonnets.&nbsp; I fear it is for very weariness that Oban
ladies sit staring out of the windows on the empty streets and
silent bay this dull and watery Sabbath night.&nbsp; I can almost
fancy I hear them sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a-weary, a-weary;<br />
Oh! would that I were dead!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="smcap">from oban to glencoe</span>.</h2>
<p>A couple of days&rsquo; heavy rain quite exhausted the
gaieties of Oban, and it was with no little pleasure that I heard
the orders given to weigh the anchor and get up steam.&nbsp; I
shed no tears as I saw the last of the long line of monster
hotels, which rejoice when the Englishman, who has, perhaps,
never been up St. Paul&rsquo;s, and who certainly has never
visited Stratford-on-Avon, makes up his mind to turn his face
northwards and do the Western Highlands and Islands of
Scotland.&nbsp; I believe the hotels are excellent.&nbsp; I am
sure one of them is&mdash;that kept by Mr. McArthur, who is an
artist, and whose son, a little lad of ten years, paints in a way
to remind one of similar achievements by Sir Thomas Lawrence; but
it is much to be regretted that so many of the best spots for
pleasant views above the town are marked off as private, and so
shut out from the tourist altogether.&nbsp; As possibly these
brief notes may be <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>read in Oban, I refer to the fact, in
order that the authorities of the place, ere it be too late, may
be reminded of the impolicy of killing the goose for the sake of
the eggs.&nbsp; There ought to be an abundance of pleasant walks
and seats around Oban to tempt the tourist to linger there.&nbsp;
It is related of Norman Macleod, as he stood on the esplanade,
pointing to the town, the bay crowded with yachts, the Kerrera
reflected on the sea as in a mirror, with the distant hills of
Morven and Mull behind, that he exclaimed, &ldquo;Where will you
find in the whole world a scene so lovely as this?&rdquo; and
this was said after he had visited America, and India, and
Palestine, and the whole continent of Europe.&nbsp; I am not
prepared exactly to endorse that statement, but the language is
natural to a Scotchman, who can see nowhere a land so romantic as
his own.&nbsp; Oban, with its fine hotels on the front, with its
beautiful bay, with its wooded or bare hills behind, looks well
from the water; but nevertheless I had tired of it, after
spending a couple of days contemplating its features from the
deckhouse of the yacht, bathed as they were in what in London we
should call unmitigated rain, but which here poetically is termed
Scottish mist.</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Well, as I have said, there was a shaking amongst the
dry bones when it became known that the morning was bright and
fine, or, in other words, that it did not rain.&nbsp; A noble
peer, who had been shut up in his yacht two whole days, came up
on deck and looked out.&nbsp; A great Birmingham man, anchored on
the other side of us, hoisted his sails and cleared off.&nbsp;
With the aid of the glass I could see the tourists turn out of
the hotels, without mackintoshes and with umbrellas furled.&nbsp;
Away flew the <i>Elena</i> past the ancient Castle of Dunollie,
the seat in former ages of the powerful Lords of Lorn, and still
the property of their lineal descendant, Colonel
Macdougall.&nbsp; Rounding Dunollie Point, and passing the Maiden
Island, the steamer enters on the broad waters of Loch Linnie,
and here a magnificent scene opens on us.&nbsp; To the left are
seen the lofty mountains of Mull, the Sound of Mull, the green
hills of Morven, the rugged peaks of Kingairloch, and the low
island of Lismore, where MacLean of Duart left his wife, a sister
of the Earl of Argyll, to perish on a rock, whilst he pretended
to solemnise her funeral with a coffin filled with stones.&nbsp;
Fortunately, the lady was rescued, and the rest of <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the
story may be read in Joanna Baillie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tragedy of
Revenge.&rdquo;&nbsp; On our right stretches the picturesque
coast of the mainland, revealing fresh beauties at every turn,
with a splendid back-ground of towering mountains, such as the
noble Ben Cruachan, who only a week since had his head covered
with snow, and the rugged hills of Glen Etive and
Glencreran.&nbsp; Lismore itself is well worthy of a short stay,
as one of the earliest spots visited by the missionary, St.
Maluag, from Iona, whose chair and well are yet shown.&nbsp;
There are also in the island the remains of an ancient
Scandinavian fortress, and many other objects of interest.&nbsp;
We pass another old castle, that of Stalker, on a small island, a
stronghold of the ancient and powerful Stewarts of Appin, who,
though now extinct, anciently ruled over this region, and,
connected with the royal family of that name, occupied a
distinguished place in Scottish story.&nbsp; In the sunlight our
trip is immensely enjoyable.&nbsp; The air has healing in its
wings.&nbsp; You feel younger and lighter every mile.&nbsp; On
the left are the splendid mountains of Kingairloch and Ardour,
and on the right those of Appin and Glencoe.&nbsp; The view of
the pass is very fine, and <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>to enjoy it
more we land at Ballachulish, and take such a drive as I may
never hope to enjoy again.&nbsp; Ballachulish itself is an
interesting place.&nbsp; Here a son of a King of Denmark was
drowned, and at the adjacent slate quarry some six hundred men
are employed at wages averaging about three pounds a-week.&nbsp;
It is their dinner hour as we pass, and I am struck with the
fineness of their <i>physique</i>.&nbsp; Though they speak mostly
Gaelic, and are shut out from English literature, they must, from
their appearance, be a decent set.&nbsp; In an English mining
village of the same size I should see a Wesleyan and a Primitive
Methodist Chapel, and a goodly array of public-houses and
beer-shops.&nbsp; Here I see neither the one nor the other.&nbsp;
At this end of the village is an Episcopalian place of worship,
with its graveyard filled with slate stones.&nbsp; At the other
end is the Free Church, and then, separated from it by a rocky
stream, are the Established Church and the Roman Catholic
Chapel.&nbsp; The village street is, I fancy, nearly a mile long,
and the cottages, which are well built and whitewashed, seem to
me crammed with children and poultry&mdash;the former,
especially, very fine, with their <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>unclad feet,
and with hair streaming like that of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s bard.&nbsp;
How they rush after our carriage like London arabs!&nbsp; I am
sorry I don&rsquo;t carry coppers.&nbsp; Late as the season is, a
few women are hay-making.&nbsp; What sunburnt, weather-beaten,
wrinkled faces they have!&nbsp; Plump and buxom at eighteen, they
are old women when they have reached twice that age.</p>
<p>As to Glencoe, what can I say of it that is not already
recorded in the guide-books, and familiar to the reader of
English history?&nbsp; The road is carried along the edge of Loch
Leven, and is really romantic, with the rocks on one side, the
winding glen in front, and the loch beneath.&nbsp; It is very
narrow, and as we meet two four-horse cars returning with
tourists we have scarce room to pass.&nbsp; Another inch would
send us howling over into the loch below, but our steeds and our
driver are trustworthy, and no such accident is to be
feared.&nbsp; In the loch beneath we see St. Mungo&rsquo;s Isle,
marked by the ruins of a chapel, and long used as a burial-place,
the Lochaber people at one end, the Glencoe people at the other,
as their dust may no more intermingle than may that of Churchmen
and Dissenters in some parts of <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>England.&nbsp; A little further on is the gable wall,
still standing, of the house of M&lsquo;Ian, the unfortunate
chief, who was shot down by his own fireside on that memorable
morning of February, 1690.&nbsp; Is it for this the Glasgow
people erected a statue to William III.?&nbsp; Further on we see
the stones still remaining of what were once houses in which
lived and loved fair women and brave men.&nbsp; One sickens now
as we read the story of that atrocious massacre.&nbsp; A little
more on our right is a rocky knoll, from which, it is said, the
signal pistol-shot was fired.&nbsp; Happily, such atrocities are
now out of date, but the blot remains to sully the fair fame of
our great Protestant hero, and to stain to all eternity the
memories of such men as Argyll and Stairs.&nbsp; Independently of
the massacre, the spot is well worthy of a visit.&nbsp; There is
no more rocky and weird a glen in all Scotland, and when the sun
is hidden the aspect of the place is sombre in the extreme, and
the further you advance the more does it become such.&nbsp; The
larch and fir disappear from the sides of the hills, the river
Coe dashes angrily and noisily at their feet, and before us is
the waterfall which, here they tell us, was Ossian&rsquo;s
shower-bath.&nbsp; Close by, Ossian <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>himself is
reported to have been born, and what more natural than that he
should thus have utilised the stream?&nbsp; On the south is the
mountain of Malmor, and to the north is the celebrated Car Fion,
or the hill of Fingal.&nbsp; I gather a thistle as a souvenir of
the place.&nbsp; Of course it is a Scotch thistle, therefore to
be honoured, but for the credit of my native land, I must say it
is a pigmy to such as I have seen within a dozen miles of St.
Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; As a Saxon, I am especially interested in the
horned sheep in these parts, which at first sight naturally you
take for goats; with the Highland cattle, though by no means the
fine specimens you see at the Agricultural Hall, and with the
exquisite aroma (when taken in moderation) of the Ben Nevis
&ldquo;mountain dew.&rdquo;&nbsp; Returning, we pass the entrance
to the Caledonian Canal&mdash;called by the natives the
cana<i>w</i>l&mdash;along which we were to have made our way to
Nairn; but the <i>Elena</i> scorns the narrow confines of the
canal, and claims to be a free rover of the sea.</p>

<span class="smcap">off mull</span>.</h2>
<p>As I sit musing in the dining-saloon of the <i>Elena</i>, it
occurs to me that a Scotchman is bound to be a better educated
man than an Englishman; for these simple reasons&mdash;in the
first place, he does not drink beer&mdash;and beer is fatal to
the intellect, inasmuch as it magnifies and fattens the body; and
secondly, because the climate compels him to lead the life of a
student.&nbsp; In the south, we Englishmen have fine
weather.&nbsp; In this world everything is comparative.&nbsp; We
in Middlesex may not have the warm sunshine and blue skies of
France or Italy, but we have weather which admits of garden
parties, and country sports, and pastimes; up in this region of
mountain, rock, and river, it is perpetually blowing big guns or
raining cats and dogs, and the Scotchman, as he can&rsquo;t go
out, must sit at home and improve his mind.&nbsp; In dull weather
Oban is not a lively spot, <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>but here at
Tobermory dulness fails adequately to express the thorough
stagnation of the place.&nbsp; Few of my readers have ever heard
of Tobermory; yet Tobermory is the principal town&mdash;indeed,
the only one that is to be found in all Mull.&nbsp; It rose to
its present height of greatness as far back as the year 1788,
when it was developed under the auspices of the Society for the
Encouragement of British Fisheries.&nbsp; But the place was
founded before then, as three or four miles off there are the
remains of a monastery, and in a niche in the wall of one of the
hotels there was, evidently, a crucifix or an image of the Virgin
Mary, whose name seems to be connected with the town.&nbsp;
Tobermory means Well of St. Mary, and up at the top of the town
there is shown to you the well of that name.&nbsp; The
<i>Florida</i>, one of the ships of the Spanish Armada, was sunk
off Tobermory, and some of her timbers and her brass and iron
guns have occasionally been fished up.&nbsp; The place must be
valuable, as the present proprietor gave &pound;90,000 for the
estate, which had been bought by the former owner for about a
third of that sum.&nbsp; The house and ground are on the left,
and his yacht lies in the bay as we enter.&nbsp; By our side are
a few trading vessels <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>which have entered the harbour for
shelter.&nbsp; On the right, at the entrance of the harbour, is a
rock, on which some one has had painted, in large red letters,
&ldquo;God is love.&rdquo;&nbsp; In rough seas, on this
rock-bound coast, where the wind howls like a hurricane as it
rushes down the gorges of the hills, and where the Atlantic seems
to gather up its strength, here and there, at fitful intervals,
ere it becomes still and tame&mdash;under the soothing influence
of Scotch bag-pipes&mdash;it is well to remind the traveller on
the deep that He, who holds the waters in the hollow of His
hands, is love.&nbsp; Tobermory is, I imagine, a very religious
place; on a Sunday night the Sheriff preaches in the Court House,
and there, on our left, is a Baptist chapel&mdash;where, once
upon a time, the Doctor preached, and in his warmth upset the
candle over the head and shoulders of his colleague sitting
below&mdash;and up on the hill is a kirk and a churchyard; the
latter, as is the case with all the churchyards in this part of
the world, in a truly disgraceful state of neglect, with the
graves, which are but a few inches deep, covered with long grass
and weeds.&nbsp; At one corner is what evidently was a receptacle
for holy water, and all around the place there is an
antiquity&mdash;in the <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>grass growing in many of the streets,
in the deserted walls of houses crumbling to decay, in the
weather-beaten, ancient look of the people, certainly by no means
suggestive of gaiety or life.&nbsp; Tobermory reminds me, says
the Doctor, of what the auld woman said of the sermon&mdash;that
it was neither amusing nor edifying.&nbsp; The Doctor&rsquo;s
lady, overcome by her feelings, writes verses, which I transcribe
for the benefit of my readers who may not enjoy the honour of her
acquaintance.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Off Mull<br />
&rsquo;Tis rather dull.<br />
Hope is vain,<br />
Down pours the rain;<br />
The wind howls<br />
Like groans of ghouls.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the subject is too much for her, and we land to have a
chat with the natives.&nbsp; A deal we get out of them, as we
wander, something like the river of the poet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Remote, unfriended, melancholy,
slow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They seem to me suspicious and reserved, as the Irishman when
at home.&nbsp; We meet one of the natives&mdash;an ancient
mariner, with a long, grey beard, and glistening eye.&nbsp; He
can tell us all about the legends connected with the Well of St.
Mary, we are told.</p>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;You have lived here all your life?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replies he, thoughtfully, picking the
lower set of left grinders in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know the place well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; says he, commencing picking on the
other side of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can tell us all about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sure,&rdquo; says he, as he calmly proceeds to
pick the remainder of his teeth individually and
collectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the well&mdash;you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is up there,&rdquo; pointing to the spot we had
just left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the people call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Well of St. Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell us why?&rdquo; said we, thinking that at
last the secret which had been hidden from the policeman of the
district and the inn-keeper (I beg his pardon, in these parts
every little cabin in which you can buy whisky or get a crust of
bread is an hotel), and every man we met.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you
tell me why the place is so called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the Well of St.
Mary&mdash;that is the question.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he shut
up&mdash;the oracle was dumb.&nbsp; I need not describe my
feelings of <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>disappointment.&nbsp; I could have
punched that man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>I learn that Mull is a cheap place&mdash;as it ought to
be&mdash;to live in.&nbsp; In Tobermory, butter&mdash;beautiful
in its way&mdash;is eighteenpence a-pound; mutton, tenpence;
eggs, eightpence a dozen; and, says my informant, things are now
very dear.&nbsp; The people are agricultural, and each one
cultivates his little crop.&nbsp; The women are fearfully and
wonderfully made; they seem born for hard work, and a large
number of the young ones leave yearly for Glasgow, where, as
maids-of-all-work, they are much in request.&nbsp; In the mud and
rain, children, barefooted, come out to stare.&nbsp; The girls
have no bonnets on, the boys mostly wear kilts, but they have all
the advantages of a school, and the steamers from Oban now and
then bring batches of the Glasgow papers.&nbsp; One of the things
that most strikes a stranger in these Western isles is the
astonishing number of sweetshops.&nbsp; Every one is born, it is
said, with a sweet tooth in his head, but here every islander
must have a dozen at least.&nbsp; Tobermory is no exception to
the general rule.&nbsp; The lower part of the town, at the far
end of the bay, is chiefly devoted to trade, and at every other
shop I see sweets <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>exposed for sale.&nbsp; It is the
same at Portree, the capital of Skye, and it is the same at the
still more important town of Stornoway, in the island of
Lewis.&nbsp; At Tobermory, one sees in the shop windows, besides
ship stores, mutton&mdash;you never see beef either in the Inner
or Outer Hebrides; articles symptomatic of feminine love for
fashion&mdash;actually a skating-rink hat being one of the
attractions at one of the leading shops, though I can&rsquo;t
hear of a skating-rink on this side of the world at all.&nbsp; In
the interior of the island are farmers and farmers&rsquo; wives,
who evidently have cash to spare.&nbsp; As we skirt along the
coast we see here and there a grey castle in ruins, telling of a
time and manners and customs long since passed away.&nbsp; At one
castle&mdash;that of Moy, for instance&mdash;the laird was a real
knight and chief, and behaved as such.&nbsp; One part of the
castle was built over a precipice, and in the wall was a niche in
which a man could just stand, and barely that; a man or woman
charged with a crime was placed in that niche; after a certain
time the door was opened, and if he or she was still standing the
result was a verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had
strength or nerve failed, the unhappy individual was considered
guilty and had <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>received the punishment due to his or
her crime.&nbsp; It was rather hard, this, for weak brethren, and
perhaps it is as well that the system is in existence no
longer.&nbsp; There was a good deal of the right that is born of
might in Scotland then; it is to be hoped that the land is
happier now with its castles in ruins, and its sons and daughters
wanderers on the face of the earth, farming in Canada, climbing
to wealth and power in the United States, governing in India,
growing wool in Natal, coming to the front with true Scotch
tenacity and instinct everywhere.&nbsp; At the same time, when we
need men for our armies and our fleets, and remember that the
flower of them come from such islands as Mull, one may regret the
forced exile of these hardy sons of the Celt or the Norseman.</p>

<span class="smcap">fast day at portree</span>.</h2>
<p>In rough weather it requires no little courage to make
one&rsquo;s way in a steamer from Tobermory to Portree, the
capital of the Isle of Skye.&nbsp; Our noble-hearted owner is
very careful on this point.&nbsp; The <i>Elena</i> is a beautiful
yacht, and he treats her tenderly.&nbsp; It is true, off
Ardanamurchan Point we tumble about on the troubled waves of the
Atlantic, and are glad to shelter in the quiet harbour of
Oronsay, where we pass the night, after the Doctor&rsquo;s lady
has gone on shore in search of milk, whilst the Doctor smokes his
cigar on the top of the highest spot he can find, and I interview
the one policeman of the district, who is unable to put on his
official costume, as he tells me it rained heavily yesterday, and
his clothes are hung by the fire to dry.&nbsp; At Oronsay there
are some six houses, including what is called an hotel.&nbsp;
Here and there are some old <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>tubs about us
which would cause Mr. Plimsoll&rsquo;s hair to stand on an end,
and which seek in this stagnant spot shelter from the gale.&nbsp;
Next morning we resume our voyage, leaving Oronsay with a very
light heart&mdash;to quote a celebrated phrase&mdash;and in a few
hours are at Portree, after passing the residence of the
Macdonald who is a descendant of the Lord of the Isles, and such
islands as Rum and Muck, and others with names equally unpoetical
in English ears.&nbsp; From afar we watch the giant hills of the
Isle of Skye, their summits wreathed in clouds.&nbsp; Mr. Black
and Mr. Smith have between them much to answer for.&nbsp; They
write of fine weather when the sun shines, when you may see ocean
and heaven and earth all alike, serene and beautiful, when the
novelty and the beauty of the scene excite wonder and praise and
joy.&nbsp; It is then people are glad to come to the Isle of
Skye, and find a charm in its lonely and rustic life, in its
tranquil lochs and its purple hills; but I fancy in Skye it is as
often wet as not; and when we were there the rain was in the
ascendant, and one would, except for the name of the thing, have
been often just as soon at home.&nbsp; Mr. Spurgeon once said to
a Scotchman, as he was <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>pointing out the grandeur of a
Highland scene, that it seemed as if God, after He had finished
making the world, got together all the spare rubbish, and shot it
down there.&nbsp; Apparently something similar has been done with
regard to Skye.&nbsp; You are bewildered with their number and
variety&mdash;rocks to the right, rocks to the left, rocks
before, rocks behind, rocks rising steep out of the sea with all
sorts of rugged outlines, rocks sloping away into wide moors
where no life is to be seen, or into lochs where the fish have it
almost all to themselves.&nbsp; It is as well that it should be
so.&nbsp; The land does not flow with milk and honey.&nbsp; The
hut of a Skye peasant, with its turf walls, its bare and filthy
floor, not the sweeter for the fact that the cow&mdash;if the
owner is rich enough to have one&mdash;sleeps behind, its peat
fire, with no chimney for the escape of smoke, its bare-legged
boys and girls, its sombre men, its gaunt women, seemed to me the
climax of human wretchedness.</p>
<p>It is with no common pleasure we get in our boat and are rowed
ashore.&nbsp; It is a secular day with us in England.&nbsp; Here,
in Portree, it is fast day, and all the shops are closed, and if
we had not laid in a stock of mutton at Oronsay, it <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>would
have been fast day with us on board the <i>Elena</i> as well as
with the pious people ashore.&nbsp; It seems to me there are
services in the churches, either in English or in Gaelic, all day
long.&nbsp; Of course I attend the Gaelic sermon.&nbsp; It is
recorded of an old Duke of Argyll that on one occasion he was
heard to declare that if he wanted to court a young lady he would
talk French, as that was the language of flattery; that if he
wished to curse and swear, he would have recourse to English; but
that if he wanted to worship God, he would employ the Gaelic
tongue.&nbsp; It may be that I heard a bad specimen, as the
sermon or service did not seem to be particularly impressive; and
as the preacher took a whole hour in which to expound and amplify
his text, it must be admitted that, considering I did not
understand a word of it, it was not a little wearying.&nbsp; I
must, however, own that the people listened with the utmost
attention, and that even such of them as were asleep all the
time, slept in a quiet, subdued, and reverential manner.&nbsp;
Indeed, they think much of religion in this Isle of Skye, and
have a profound respect for the clergy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;
said an island guide one day, as he was speaking of a
distinguished divine, <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>whom he had attended during a summer
tour&mdash;&ldquo;sure he&rsquo;s a verra godly man, he gave me a
drink out o&rsquo; his ain flask.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet Portree is
not a drinking place.&nbsp; There are two or three good hotels
for the tourists, and little more.&nbsp; I saw no sign of
intoxication on the evening of the fast day, but I did see
churches filled, and all business suspended, and the sight of the
Gaelic congregation was extremely interesting.&nbsp; The men in
good warm home-spun frieze, the women with clean faces, and plaid
shawls, and white caps, the younger ones with the last new thing
in bonnets, looking as unlike the big, bare-footed damsels of the
streets, and the old withered women whom you see coming in from
the wide and dreary moor, as it is possible to imagine.&nbsp; In
London heresy may prevail&mdash;sometimes, it is said, it crosses
the Scottish border; but here, at any rate, since the Reformation
has flourished the sincere milk of the Word.&nbsp; These men and
women have their Gaelic Bible, and that they cling to as their
guide in life, their comfort in adversity, their stay and support
in death, and as the foundation of their hopes of immortal life
and joy.&nbsp; An old gossiping writer, who died a year or two
since, relates how a Presbyterian clergyman <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>confessed to
him that his congregation, who only used the Gaelic, were so well
versed in theology, that it was impossible for him to go beyond
their reach in the most profound doctrines of Christianity.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is as well for some ministers whom I have heard, but
should be sorry to name, that they have not Gaelic hearers.&nbsp;
They must be terrible fellows to preach to, these men, fed on the
Shorter Catechism, the Proverbs of Solomon, and the rest of the
Old and New Testaments.&nbsp; It is little to them what the
philosophers think.&nbsp; Mill, and Spencer, and Tyndall, and
Huxley they ignore.&nbsp; Dark-eyed, black-haired, with heads
which you might knock against a rock without cracking, and with
arms and legs that one would fancy could stop the Flying
Dutchman,&mdash;evidently these are not the men to be tossed
about with every wind of doctrine or cunning craftiness of men
who lie in wait to deceive.&nbsp; Little pity would they have for
the imperfect, weak-kneed brother, who, in the pulpit or out of
it, could presume to doubt what they had learnt at their
mothers&rsquo; knees.&nbsp; Up here in Skye, the religion known
is bright and clear.&nbsp; The shops are of the poorest
description, merely one room in a common dwelling, with a stone
or earth <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>floor.&nbsp; There is no paper
published in all the Isle of Skye, but the people believe.&nbsp;
You man of the nineteenth century, the heir of all the ages
underneath the sun, would think little of the peasant of that
wintry region.&nbsp; I believe he thinks as little of you as you
do of him.&nbsp; You mock, and he believes; you scorn, and he
worships; you stammer about Protoplasms and Evolutions, he says
in his old Gaelic tongue, &ldquo;God said, Let there be light,
and there was light.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many in London who
would give all that they have if they could believe as these men
and women of the North.</p>
<p>There were sermons again in the afternoon, sermons at night,
sermons again next day, sermons on the coming Sunday, and to them
came the fisher from the sea, the little tradesman from his shop,
the ploughman from his croft, the milkmaid from her dairy, and
the child from school; and it must further be remembered that
these fasts are voluntary, and not in accordance with Acts of
Parliament.&nbsp; Remember, also, that nothing is done to make
the service attractive.&nbsp; It is simply the usual form of
Presbyterian worship that is followed.&nbsp; The chapel was as
plain as could be, and the singing was almost <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>funereal.&nbsp; But, after all, the chapel was to be
preferred to the empty streets, along which the wind raged like a
hurricane, or to the contemplation of bleak rocks and angry
seas.&nbsp; I can quite believe at Skye it is more comfortable to
go to kirk than stay at home.&nbsp; Indeed, more than once on the
night after, I felt perhaps my safest place would have been the
kirk, as the wind came rushing in through a gully in the
mountains, and kept the water in a constant fury.&nbsp; Really,
from the deck of the <i>Elena</i>, Portree looked a very
comfortable place, with the bay lined with buildings, and
conspicuous among them all the Imperial Hotel, where the Empress
of the French stayed while travelling in these parts.&nbsp; There
is a good deal of excitement here as steamers rush in and out,
and yachts lazily drop their anchors.&nbsp; It seems to me that
the people quite appreciate the charms of their rocky
island.&nbsp; Coming down the cliff, I saw a
notice&mdash;&ldquo;Furnished Apartments to Let&rdquo;&mdash;and
the price asked was quite conclusive on that head.&nbsp; Down by
the harbour an enterprising Scot, who had been a
gentleman&rsquo;s servant in London, had established a store for
the sale of bottled beer and such pleasant drinks, and seemed
quite satisfied <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>with the result of his
experiment.&nbsp; At any rate, he preferred Portree to residence
further inland, where he said even the very eggs were uneatable,
so strongly did they taste of peat.&nbsp; My lady
friend&mdash;rather, I should say, &ldquo;our
lady&rdquo;&mdash;is as much affected by the gale that dolorous
night as myself, and writes, plaintively begging me to excuse the
irregularity of the metre on account of the rolling of the
vessel, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here off Skye,<br />
The tide runs high;<br />
Through hill and glen<br />
Wind howls again.<br />
The Coolan hills<br />
No more we see,<br />
Save through the mists<br />
Of memory.<br />
The sea birds float,<br />
And seem to gloat,<br />
With loud, shrill note,<br />
Above our boat;<br />
For they, like us,<br />
Are forced to stay<br />
For shelter in this friendly bay;<br />
And now I seek, in balmy sleep,<br />
Oblivion of the perils of the deep,<br />
And wishing rocks and hills good night,<br />
Let&rsquo;s hope to-morrow&rsquo;s log will be more
bright.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A cottage in the Hebrides is by no means a cottage
<i>orn&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp; Its walls are made of stone and <!--
page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>clay of a tremendous thickness.&nbsp; On this wall, on a
framework of old oars or old wood, are laid large turfs and a
roof of thatch.&nbsp; In this roof the fowls nestle, and lay an
infinite number of eggs; but all things inside and out are
tainted with turf in a way to make them disagreeable.&nbsp; There
is no chimney, and but one door, and the floor is the bare earth,
with a bench for the family formed of earth or peat or
stone.&nbsp; Beds and bedding are unknown.&nbsp; If the family
keeps a cow, that has the best corner, for it is what the pig is
to the Irishman, the gentleman that pays the rent.&nbsp; Small
sheep, almost as horned and hardy as goats, may be met with, but
never pigs.&nbsp; Pork seems an abomination in the eyes of the
natives.&nbsp; Every cotter has a portion of the adjacent moor in
which to cut peat sufficient to supply his wants.&nbsp; Out of
the homespun wool the women make good warm garments&mdash;and
they need them.&nbsp; Fish and porridge seem their principal
diet, and it agrees with them.&nbsp; The girls are wonderfully
fat and healthy; and consumption is utterly unknown.&nbsp; While
I was at Stornoway, an old woman had just died in the workhouse
considerably over a century old.&nbsp; As to agricultural
operations, they are conducted on a most primitive <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>scale.&nbsp; A few potatoes may here and there be seen
struggling for dear life; and as the hay is cut when the sun
shines, it is often in August or September that the farmer reaps
his scanty harvest.&nbsp; You miss the flowers which hide the
deformity of the peasant&rsquo;s cottage in dear old
England.&nbsp; It seems altogether in these distant regions,
where the wild waves of the Atlantic dash and roar; where the
days are dark with cloud; where you see nothing but rock, and
glen, and moorland; where forests are an innovation, that man
fights with the opposing powers of nature for existence under
very great disadvantage.</p>

73</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smcap">to stornoway</span>.</h2>
<p>A fine day came at last, and we steered off from Portree,
leaving the grand Cachullin Mountains, rising to a height of
3,220 feet, and the grave of Flora Macdonald, and the cave where
Prince Charles hid himself far behind.&nbsp; On the right were
the distant mountains of Ross-shire, and on our left Skye, and
the other islands which guard the Western Highlands against the
awful storms of the ever-restless Atlantic.&nbsp; Here, as
elsewhere, was to be noticed the absence of all human life,
whether at sea or on land.&nbsp; It was only now and then we saw
a sail, but, as if to compensate for their absence, the birds of
the air and the fishes of the sea seemed to follow in a
never-ending crowd.&nbsp; More than once we saw a couple of
whales spouting and blowing from afar, and the gulls, and divers,
and solan-geese at times made the surface of the water absolutely
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>white, like snow-islands floating leisurely along.&nbsp;
Just before we got up to Stornoway, at a great distance on our
right, Cape Wrath, more than a hundred miles off, lifted up its
head into the clear blue sky, the protecting genius, as it were,
of the Scottish strand.&nbsp; It was perfectly delightful, this;
one felt not only that in Scotland people had at rare intervals
fine weather, but that by means of steamers and yachts and
sailing vessels of all kinds, the people of Scotland knew how to
improve the shining hour.&nbsp; It was beautiful, this floating
on a glassy sea, clear as a looking-glass, in which were
reflected the clouds, and the skies, and the sun, and the birds
of the air, and the rocks, with a wonderful fidelity.&nbsp; It
seemed that you had only to plunge into that cool and tempting
depth, and to be in heaven at once.&nbsp; At Stornoway we spent a
couple of days.&nbsp; The town stands in a bay, perhaps not quite
so romantic as some in which we have sheltered, but very
picturesque, nevertheless.&nbsp; The first object to be
distinctly seen as we entered was the fine castle which Sir James
Mathieson has erected for himself, at a cost altogether of half a
million, and the grounds of which are in beautiful order; them we
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>had ample time to inspect that evening, as in Stornoway
the daylight lasted till nearly ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Happily,
Sir James was at home, and we on board the yacht had an
acceptable present of vegetables, and cream, and butter, very
welcome to us poor toilers of the sea.&nbsp; Stornoway is a very
busy place, and has at this time of the year a population of
2,500.&nbsp; In May and June it is busier still, as at that time
there will be as many as five hundred fishing boats in the
harbour, and a large extra population are employed on shore in
curing and packing the fish.&nbsp; In the country behind are
lakes well stocked with fish, and mountains and moors where game
and wild deer and real eagles yet abound.&nbsp; But a great
drawback is the climate.&nbsp; An old sportsman
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;The savagery of the weather in the Lewes,
the island of which Stornoway is the capital, is not to be
described.&nbsp; A gentleman from the county of Clare once shot a
season with me, and had very good sport, which he enjoyed
much.&nbsp; I asked him to come again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not for five
thousand pounds a year,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;would I
encounter this climate again.&nbsp; I am delighted I came, for
now I can go back to my own country with pleasure, since, bad as
the <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>climate is, it is Elysium to this.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Let me say, however, the weather was superb all the time the
<i>Elena</i> was at Stornoway.</p>
<p>As a town, Stornoway is an immense improvement on
Portree.&nbsp; It rejoices in churches, and the shops are
numerous, and abound with all sorts of useful articles.&nbsp; The
chief streets are paved.&nbsp; It has here and there a gas lamp,
and the proprietor of the chief hotel boasted to me that so
excellent were his culinary arrangements, that actually the
ladies from the yachts come and dine there.&nbsp; Stornoway has a
Freemasons&rsquo; Hall, and, wandering in one of the streets, I
came to a public library, which I found was open once a
week.&nbsp; On Saturday night the shops swarmed with customers,
chiefly peasant women&mdash;who put their boots on when they came
into the town, and who took them off again and walked barefoot as
soon as they had left the town behind&mdash;and ancient mariners,
with a very fish-like smell.&nbsp; On Sunday the churches were
full, and at the Free Church, where the service was in Gaelic,
the crowd was great.&nbsp; In a smaller church I heard a cousin
of Norman Macleod&mdash;a fine, burly man&mdash;preach a powerful
sermon, which seemed to me made up partly of two
sermons&mdash;one by <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>the late T. T. Lynch, and the other
by the late Alfred Morris.&nbsp; I strayed also into a U. P.
church, but there, alas! the audience was small.&nbsp; In
Stornoway, as elsewhere, the couplet is true&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The free kirk, the poor kirk, the kirk
without the steeple,<br />
The auld kirk, the rich kirk, the kirk without the
people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the Monday morning we turned our faces homeward, and as the
weather was fine, we passed outside Skye, and saw Dunvegan Bay,
of which Alexander Smith writes so much; passing rocky islands,
all more or less known to song, and caves with dark legends of
blood, and cruelty, and crime.&nbsp; One night was spent in
Bunessan Bay, where some noble sportsmen were very needlessly,
but, <i>con amore</i>, butchering the few peaceful seals to be
found in those parts; and a short while we lay off Staffa, which
rises straight out of the water like an old cathedral, where the
winds and waves ever play a solemn dirge.&nbsp; In its way, I
know nothing more sublime than Staffa, with its grey arch and
black columns and rushing waves.&nbsp; No picture or photograph I
have seen ever can give any adequate idea of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Altogether,&rdquo; writes Miss Gordon Cumming, &ldquo;it
is a scene of which no words can convey the smallest idea;&rdquo;
and for once I agree with the <!-- page 78--><a

It is seldom the reality surpasses your expectations.&nbsp; As
regards myself, in the case of Staffa I must admit it did.</p>
<p>The same morning we land at Columba, or the Holy Isle.&nbsp;
The story of St. Columba&rsquo;s visit to Iona is laid somewhere
in the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 563.&nbsp; He, it
seems, according to some authorities, was an Irishman, and from
Iona he and his companions made the tour of Pagan Scotland; and
hence now Scotland is true blue Presbyterian and always
Protestant.&nbsp; Here, as at Staffa, we miss the tourists, who
scamper and chatter for an hour at each place, and then are off;
and I was glad.&nbsp; As Byron writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I love not man the less,
but nature more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From these our interviews, in
which I steal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From all I may be or have been before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To mingle with the universe, and
feel<br />
What I can ne&rsquo;er express, yet cannot all
conceal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of Iona is a history of untold beauty and human
interest.&nbsp; Druids, Pagans, Christian saints, have all
inhabited the Holy Isle.&nbsp; Proud kings, like Haco of Norway,
were here consecrated, and here&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Beneath
the showery west,<br />
The mighty kings of three fair realms were laid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that I could do was to visit the ruins of the <!-- page
79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>monastery and the cathedral, and one of the stone
crosses, of which there were at one time 360, and to regret that
these beautiful monoliths were cast into the sea by the orders of
the Synod as &ldquo;monuments of idolatrie.&rdquo;&nbsp; St.
Columba, like all the saints, was a little ungallant as regards
the fair sex.&nbsp; Perhaps it is as well that his rule is
over.&nbsp; He would not allow even cattle on the sacred
isle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where there is a cow,&rdquo; argued the saint,
&ldquo;there must be a woman; and where there is a woman there
must be mischief.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly, the ladies have very much
improved since the lamented decease of the saint.&nbsp; From Iona
we made our way to the very prosperous home of commerce and
whisky known as Campbeltown.&nbsp; Actually, the duty on the
latter article paid by the Campbeltown manufacturers amounts to
as much as &pound;60,000 a year.&nbsp; At one time it was the
very centre of Scottish life.&nbsp; For three centuries it was
the capital of Scotland.&nbsp; It is still a very busy place, and
it amused me much of a night to watch the big, bare-footed,
bare-headed women crowding round the fine cross in the High
Street, which ornaments what I suppose may be called the
Parochial Pump.&nbsp; Close to the town is the church and cave of
St. Kieran, <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>the Apostle of Cantyre, the tutor of
St. Columba.&nbsp; At present the chief boast of Campbeltown is
that there were born the late Norman Macleod and Burns&rsquo;
Highland Mary.&nbsp; When Macleod was a boy the days of smuggling
were not yet over in that part of the world.&nbsp; Here is one of
his stories:&mdash;&ldquo;Once an old woman was being tried
before the Sheriff, and it fell to his painful duty to sentence
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dare say,&rsquo; he said uneasily to the
culprit, &lsquo;it is not often you have fallen into this
fault.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, indeed, shura,&rsquo; was the
reply; &lsquo;I hae na made a drap since yon wee keg I sent
yoursel&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me remark, <i>en
passant</i>, that my friend, the Doctor, was born here, and that
is proof positive that at Campbeltown the breed of great men is
not yet exhausted.&nbsp; I mention this to our lady, and she is
of the same opinion.</p>

<span class="smcap">kintyre and campbeltown</span>.</h2>
<p>In my wanderings in the latter town I pick up the last edition
of a useful and unpretending volume called &ldquo;The History of
Kintyre,&rdquo; by Mr. Peter M&lsquo;Intosh&mdash;a useful
citizen who carried on the profession of a catechist, and who is
now no more.&nbsp; The book has merits of its own, as it shows
how much may be done by any ordinary man of average ability who
writes of what he has seen and heard.&nbsp; Kintyre is a
peninsula on the extreme south of the shire of Argyle, in length
about forty geographical miles.&nbsp; That the Fingalians
occasionally resided at Kintyre is without doubt, and a
description of their bravery and generosity is graphically given
in some of the poems of Ossian.&nbsp; At one time there was much
wood in its lowlands, and in them were elk, deer, wild boars,
&amp;c., and the rivers abounded with fish.&nbsp; There were
clans who gathered together with the greatest <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>enthusiasm
around their chiefs, who repaired to a high hill, and set up a
large fire on the top of it, in full view of the surrounding
district, each unfolding his banner, ensign, or pennant, his
pipers playing appropriate tunes.&nbsp; The clan got into motion,
repaired to their chief like mountain streams rushing into the
ocean.&nbsp; He eloquently addressed them in the heart-stirring
language of the Gael, and, somewhat like a Kaffir chief of the
present day, dwelt at length on the heroism of his
ancestors.&nbsp; The will of the chief instantly became law, and
preparations were soon made; the chief in his uniform of clan
tartan takes the lead, the pipers play well-known airs, and the
men follow, their swords and spears glittering in the air.</p>
<p>Up to very recent times there were those who remembered this
state of things.&nbsp; An old man who died not a century ago told
my informant, writes Mr. M&lsquo;Intosh, that the first thing he
ever recollected was a great struggle between his father and his
mother in consequence of the father preparing to join his clan in
a bloody expedition.&nbsp; The poor wife exerted all her
strength, moral and physical, but in vain.&nbsp; He left her
never to return alive from the battlefield.&nbsp; <!-- page
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>The
proprietors of Kintyre were wise in their generation, and
mustered men in their different districts to oppose Prince
Charles, partly on account of his religion, and partly to retain
their lands.&nbsp; On one occasion they marched to Falkirk, but
not in time to join in the battle, it being over before they
reached there.&nbsp; Prince Charles being victorious, they went
into a church, which the Highlanders surrounded, coming in with
their clothes dyed with blood, and crying out &ldquo;Massacre
them&rdquo;; but they were set at liberty on the ground that
their hearts were with the Prince, and had been compelled by
their chiefs to take arms on the side of the House of Hanover
against their will.&nbsp; But even the chiefs were not always
masters, and men often did that which was right in their own eyes
alone.&nbsp; An instance of this kind is traditionally told about
the Black Fisherman of Lochsanish.&nbsp; The loch, which is now
drained, was a mile in length and half-a-mile in breadth, and
contained a great number of salmon and trout.&nbsp; The Black
Fisherman would not suffer any person to live in the
neighbourhood, but claimed, by the strength of his arm, sole
dominion over the loch.&nbsp; The Chief Largie, who lived
eighteen miles north of the <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>loch, kept a
guard of soldiers, lest the Fisherman should make an attack on
him.&nbsp; He sent his soldiers daily to Balergie Cruach to see
if the Fisherman was on the loch fishing, and if they saw him
fishing they would come home, not being afraid of an attack on
that day.&nbsp; A stranger one day coming to Largie&rsquo;s house
asked him why he kept soldiers.&nbsp; The answer was, it was on
account of the Fisherman.&nbsp; When he saw him sitting he went
and fought the Fisherman, bidding the soldiers wait the result on
a neighbouring hill.&nbsp; When the battle was over, the
Fisherman was minus his head.&nbsp; We read the head, which was
very heavy, was left at Largie&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; These old men
were always fighting.&nbsp; The number of large stones we see
erected in different parts of Kintyre have been set up in memory
of battles once fought at these places.&nbsp; On one occasion two
friendly clans prepared to come and meet.&nbsp; They met
somewhere north of Tarbert, but did not know each other, and
began to ask their names, which in those days it was considered
cowardice to answer.&nbsp; They drew swords, fought fiercely, and
killed many on both sides.&nbsp; At last they found out their
mistake, were very, very sorry, and, after burying their dead,
returned to <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>their respective places.&nbsp; The
feuds and broils among the clans were frequent, and really for
the most trifling causes, as the whole clans always stood by
their chiefs, and were ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to fight
on account of any insult, real or imaginary.&nbsp; It appears
that in this distant part of the Empire, though the whole
district is not far from Glasgow, with its commerce and
manufactures, and university and newspapers, and the modern
Athens, with its great literary traditions, there still linger
many old Druid superstitions.</p>
<p>Some are particularly interesting.&nbsp; Old M&lsquo;Intosh
thus writes of May-day and the first of November, called in
Gaelic Bealtuinn, or Beil-teine, signifying Belus fire, and
Samhuinn, or serene time.</p>
<p>On the first of May the Druids kindled a large fire on the top
of a mountain, from which a good view of the horizon might be
seen, that they might see the sun rising; the inhabitants of the
whole country assembling, after extinguishing their fire, in
order to welcome the rising sun and to worship God.&nbsp; The
chief Druid, blessing the people and receiving their offerings,
gave a kindling to each householder.&nbsp; If the Druid was
displeased at any of the people, he would not <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>give him a
kindling; and no other person was allowed to give it, on pain of
being cursed, and being unfortunate all the year round.&nbsp;
This superstition is observed by some to this day.&nbsp; On the
first of November the Druids went nearly through the same
ceremony.</p>
<p>The superstition of wakes in Kintyre is nearly worn out.&nbsp;
The origin of this superstition is, that when one died the Druid
took charge of his soul, conveying it to Flath-innis, or heaven;
but the friends of the deceased were to watch, or wake, the body,
lest the evil spirits should take it away, and leave some other
substance in its place.&nbsp; When interred, it could never be
removed.</p>
<p>An old man named John M&lsquo;Taggart, who died long ago, was
owner of a fine little smack, with which he trafficked from
Kintyre to Ireland and other places.&nbsp; Being anxious to get a
fair wind to go to Ireland, and hearing of an old woman who
pretended to have the power to give this, he made a bargain with
her.&nbsp; She gave him two strings with three knots on each;
when he undid the first, he got a fine fair breeze; getting into
mid-channel he opened the second, and got a strong gale; and when
near the Irish <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>shore he wished to see the effect of
the third knot, which, when he loosed, a great hurricane blew,
which destroyed some of the houses on shore.&nbsp; With the other
string he came back to Kintyre, only opening two of the
knots.&nbsp; The old man believed in this superstition.</p>
<p>On the island of Gigha is a well with some stones in it, and
it is said that if the stones be taken out of it a great storm
will arise.&nbsp; Two or three old men told M&lsquo;Intosh that
they opened the well, and that a fearful storm arose, and they
would swear to it if pressed to confirm their belief; they would
affirm also to the existence of the Brunie in Cara.</p>
<p>In Carradale is a hill called Sroin-na-h-eana-chair, in which
it is said an old creature resides from generation to generation,
who makes a great noise before the death of individuals of a
certain clan.&nbsp; An old man with whom M&lsquo;Intosh conversed
on the subject declared that he had heard the cries himself,
which made the whole glen tremble.</p>
<p>A little dwarf, called the &ldquo;Caointeach,&rdquo; or
weeper, is said to weep before the death of some persons.&nbsp;
Some people thought this supernatural creature very
friendly.&nbsp; An old wife <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>affirmed that
she saw the little creature, about the size of a new-born infant,
weep with the voice of a young child, and shortly afterwards got
notice of the death of a friend.&nbsp; Others affirmed that they
heard the trampling of people outside of the house at night, and
shortly after a funeral left the house.&nbsp; Many stories are
told about apparitions in the hearing of the young, making an
impression which continues all their days.&nbsp; Peter the
Catechist deprecates such conduct.&nbsp; He writes: &ldquo;I have
seen those who would not turn on their heel to save their life on
the battle-field, who would tremble at the thought of passing
alone a place said to be frequented by a spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very provokingly he next observes, &ldquo;It would be
ridiculous to speak of the charms, omens, gestures, dreams,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, the fact is, it is just these things
which are matters of interest to an inquiring mind.&nbsp; They
are absurdities to us, but they were not so once; and then comes
the question, Why?&nbsp; He does, however, add a little to our
fund of information relative to the second sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old man who lived at Crossibeg, four generations
ago, saw visions, which were explained to <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>him by a
supernatural being, descriptive of future events in
Kintyre.&nbsp; An account of them was printed, and entitled
&lsquo;Porter&rsquo;s Prophecies,&rsquo; which I have perused,
but cannot tell if any of them have come to pass as yet, but some
people believed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Laird of Caraskie, more than a century ago, is said
to have had a familiar spirit called Beag-bheul, or little mouth,
which talked to him, and took great care of him and his
property.&nbsp; The spirit told him of a great battle which would
be fought in Kintyre, and that the magpie would drink human blood
from off a standing stone erected near Campbeltown.&nbsp; The
stone was removed, and set as a bridge over the mill water, over
which I have often traversed; but the battle has not been fought
as yet, and perhaps never will be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Boes, a minister of Campbeltown, more than
a century ago, was said to have the second sight.&nbsp; One time
being at the Assembly, and coming home on Saturday to preach to
his congregation, he was overtaken by a storm, which drove the
packet into Rothesay.&nbsp; He went to preach in the church on
the Sabbath.&nbsp; The rafters of the church above not being
lathed, in <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the middle of his sermon he looked
up, and with a loud voice cried, &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re there, Satan;
ye kept me from preaching to my own congregation, but ye cannot
keep me from preaching for all that,&rsquo; and then went on with
his sermon.&nbsp; At another time, his congregation having
assembled on the Sabbath as usual, the minister was walking
rapidly on the grass after the time of meeting, the elders not
being willing to disturb him by telling him the time was
expired.&nbsp; At last he clapped his hands, exclaiming,
&lsquo;Well done, John;&rsquo; the Duke of Argyle being at that
moment at the head of the British army in Flanders fighting a
battle in which he was victorious.&nbsp; The minister, by the
power of the second sight, witnessed the battle, and exclaimed,
when he saw it won, &lsquo;Well done, John.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went
afterwards and preached to his congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another Sabbath, when preaching, a member of the
congregation having fallen asleep, he cried to him
&lsquo;Awake.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a short time the man fell asleep
again.&nbsp; The minister bade him awake again and hear the
sermon.&nbsp; The man fell asleep the third time, when the
minister cried, with a loud voice, &lsquo;Awake, and hear this
sermon, for it will be the last you will ever hear in this <!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>life.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before the next Sabbath the man was
dead.&nbsp; On the morning of a Communion Sabbath, Mr. Boes got
up very early, convinced that something was wrong about the
church.&nbsp; He examined it, and found that the beams of the
gallery were almost sawn through by the emissaries of Satan, in
order that the congregation, by the falling of the gallery, might
be killed.&nbsp; He got carpenters and smiths employed till they
put the church in a safe state, and proceeded with the solemn
service of the day with great earnestness.&nbsp; Mr. Boes was
sometimes severely tried with temptations, having imaginary
combats with Satan, and, being very ill-natured, he would not
allow any person to come near him.&nbsp; On one of these
occasions he shut himself up in his room for three days.&nbsp;
His wife being afraid he would starve with hunger, sent the
servant-man with food to him, but the minister scattered it on
the floor.&nbsp; The servant-man exclaimed, &lsquo;The
devil&rsquo;s in the man!&rsquo;&nbsp; In a moment the minister,
becoming calm, answered, &lsquo;You are quite right,&rsquo; then
partook of the food, and returned to his former
habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is a good illustration of an olden
chief:&mdash;We have many traditional stories about <!-- page
94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>Saddell Castle, in which Mr. M&lsquo;Donald or
&ldquo;Righ Fionghal&rdquo; resided.&nbsp; He claimed despotic
power over the inhabitants of Kintyre.&nbsp; It is said he knew
the use of gunpowder, and often made a bad use of it.&nbsp; He
would for sport shoot people, though they did him no harm, with
his long gun, which was kept in Carradale for a long time after
his death.&nbsp; His character is represented as being very
tyrannical.&nbsp; Being once in Ireland, he saw a beautiful
married woman, whom he fancied, and took away from her husband to
Saddell.&nbsp; Her husband followed; but M&lsquo;Donald finding
him, intended to have starved him to death without his wife
knowing it.&nbsp; He was put in a barn, but he kept himself alive
by eating the corn which he found there.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Donald
removed him to another place, but a hen came in every day and
kept him alive with her eggs.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Donald was anxious
that the poor man should die, and placed him in another place,
where he got nothing to eat, and it is said the miserable
prisoner ate his own hand, then his arm to the elbow, before he
died, and said, in Gaelic, &ldquo;Dh&rsquo;ith mi mo choig meoir
a&rsquo;s mo lamh gu&rsquo;m uilleann.&nbsp; Is mor a thig air
neach nach eiginu fhulang.&rdquo;&nbsp; When they were burying
him, his wife was on the top of the <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>castle, and
asked whose funeral it was; she was told it was
Thomson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it my Thomson?&rdquo; she
inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied.&nbsp; She then
said they might stop for a little till she would be with
them.&nbsp; She immediately threw herself over the castle wall,
and was carried dead with her husband to the same grave.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, Saxon rule has not been such an injury to
the Western Isles of Scotland as some people think.&nbsp; At
Kintyre there are plenty of schools, and parsons and policemen
instead of robber chiefs; and if there are few freebooting
expeditions to Ireland and elsewhere, it is quite as well that
people have taken to a more decent mode of life.</p>
<p>Alas! my &ldquo;to-morrow&rdquo;&mdash;unlike that of the
poet, which &ldquo;never comes&rdquo;&mdash;is at hand.&nbsp;
Under a smiling sky, and on a summer sea, we thread our way past
Arran, or the Land of Sharp Pinnacles, down the Kyles of Bute,
where the scenery is of exquisite beauty; past Rothesay, the
Hastings of the West, and with an aquarium said to be the finest
in the world, and almost as flourishing as that Hastings of the
South which rejoices in a yatchsman for M.P. of unrivalled fame;
past Dunoon, till we drop anchor at <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Hunters&rsquo; Quay.&nbsp; We seem all at once to have
come into the world again.&nbsp; On every side of us there are
steamers bearing tourists, and holiday-makers, and health-seekers
to the crowded bathing-places and health resorts.&nbsp; As we
approach our journey&rsquo;s end, the Clyde seems covered with
rowing-boats, and music and laughter echo along its waters.&nbsp;
I feel a little sad to think that my brief holiday is over.&nbsp;
The Doctor and the Doctor&rsquo;s lady tell me we shall meet in
London, and that is a consolation.&nbsp; Yes, we shall meet, but
no more as equals on deck.&nbsp; He will be in the pulpit or on
the platform, I beneath.&nbsp; There is no equality when a man
puts on the black gown, and begins lecturing to the pew.&nbsp;
The mutual standpoint vanishes like a dream.&nbsp; But when, oh,
when shall I sail in such a model yacht as the <i>Elena</i>
again, or meet with such hospitality as I enjoyed at its worthy
owner&rsquo;s hands?&nbsp; His sons, amphibious as are all the
Scotchmen, apparently, in these parts, row out to meet us.&nbsp;
The greeting is as affectionate as mostly the greetings of the
British race are.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did you come back for?&nbsp;
We were getting on very well without you,&rdquo; were the first
words I heard.</p>
<h2><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smcap">back again</span>.</h2>
<p>As next morning I crossed the Clyde, and took my seat in a
crowded and early train, it seemed to me that rain was not far
off, and that at Edinburgh Royalty might be favoured with a sight
of what in England is known as Scotch mist.&nbsp; Nor were my
forebodings wrong.&nbsp; The modern Athens was under a cloud, and
many were the heavy-hearted who had come from far and near to do
honour to the day.&nbsp; The Glasgow men have but a poor opinion
of the citizens of Edinburgh.&nbsp; They took a very unfavourable
view of the matter.&nbsp; If Edinburgh desired to have a statue
of Albert the Good, why not?&nbsp; If the Queen liked to be
present at its inauguration, there was no harm in that; if there
were a little fuller ceremonial on the occasion, it was only what
was to be expected; but that Edinburgh should hasten to wash her
statues and decorate her streets; that she should clean up her
shop-fronts, <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>and drape her balconies; that she
should devote a day to holiday-making; that she should go to the
expense of Venetian masts and scarlet cloth&mdash;in short, that
in this way Edinburgh should attempt to rival a London Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s Show, was one of those things no Glasgow fellow
could understand.</p>
<p>And I own at first sight there seemed to be a good deal in the
Glasgow criticism.&nbsp; Few cities have so fair a site as the
noble metropolis of our northern brethren; few cities less
require ornamentation.&nbsp; Hers emphatically is that beauty
which unadorned is adorned the most.&nbsp; To stand in Princes
Street, with the castle frowning on you on one side, and with the
Calton Hill in front; to loiter under the fair memorial to Sir
Walter Scott (by the side of which I am pleased to see a statue
of Livingstone has just been placed); to look from the bridge
which connects the New Town with the Old&mdash;on the distant
hills and the blue sea beyond&mdash;is a pleasure in
itself.&nbsp; With its far-reaching associations, with its
memories of Wilson and Brougham, and Jeffery and Walter Scott,
with its dark churches, in which John Knox thundered away at the
fair and frail Mary, with its <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>ancient
palaces grim and venerable with stirring romance or startling
crime, it seemed almost profane to send for the upholsterer, and
to bid him deck out the streets and squares with gaudy colours
and gay flowers.&nbsp; When on Thursday the morning opened
cloudily on the scene, it seemed as if all this preparation had
been thrown away; and bright eyes were for awhile dark and sad,
and refusing to be comforted.&nbsp; However, the thing went on,
nevertheless.&nbsp; The crowd turned out into the streets, the
railways brought their tens of thousands from far and near;
balconies were full, and all the windows; and the sight was one
such as has not feasted the eyes of the oldest inhabitant for
many a year.&nbsp; There were the soldiers to line the streets,
there were the archers to guard the da&iuml;s, there were the
Town Council and Lord Provost in their scarlet robes, there were
the men whom Edinburgh delights to honour all before them, and,
above all, the Duke of Connaught, the Princess Beatrice, Prince
Leopold, Brown&mdash;the far-famed Highlander&mdash;and the
Queen.&nbsp; The ceremony itself was not long.&nbsp; When
Charlotte Square was reached, Her Majesty took the place assigned
to her, and the work was speedily performed.&nbsp; As <!-- page
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>Her Majesty went back by Princes Street, an additional
interest was created, and Princes Street looked very well; its
hotels and fashionable shops rejoiced in crimson and yellow
banners, and the Walter Scott memorial even broke out in honour
of the day.&nbsp; It was decorated with flags, which waved gaily
in the sun&mdash;for the sun did come out, after all.&nbsp; But
Princes Street was not the chief route.&nbsp; It was down George
Street that Royalty drove, and it was there that the efforts of
the decorative artist had been most effective.&nbsp; Some of them
were very beautiful, and full of taste; but the lettering was
rather small.&nbsp; Nor did the inscriptions display much
ingenuity.&nbsp; They were mostly &ldquo;Welcomes,&rdquo; or
invitations to &ldquo;Come again.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the
advertising tradesmen who were most ingenious in that way, and it
was in the papers that their efforts appeared.&nbsp; As, for
instance, an enterprising shoemaker writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Welcome, Victoria!&nbsp; Queen of Scottish
hearts!<br />
In many a breast the loyal impulse starts&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then finishes with a recommendation of his boots and
shoes.&nbsp; As a crowd, also, it must be noted that the mob was
far graver than a London one, and that little attempt was made
either to relieve the tedium of waiting the arrival of <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>the procession, or to turn a penny by the sale of the
various articles which seem invariably to be required by a London
mob.&nbsp; The boys who sell the evening papers, one would have
thought, would have had correct programmes of the procession, and
portraits of the Queen and Prince Albert to dispose of.&nbsp; As
it was, all that was hawked about was an engraving of the statue
itself.</p>
<p>As to the statue, it will be one of the many for which
Edinburgh is famous, and at present, as the latest, is considered
one of the best.&nbsp; It is in a good position in Charlotte
Square&mdash;the finest of the Edinburgh squares&mdash;and stands
by itself.&nbsp; Afar off is William Pitt; and, further off
still, unfortunately for the morals of Albert the Good, who is
placed just by, is George the Magnificent, swaggering in his
cloak, in tipsy gravity, as it were; and at St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Square, at the other end, proudly towers above all the Melville
Monument.&nbsp; That was utilised on the day in question in an
admirable manner&mdash;Venetian masts were erected at the end of
the grass-plat which surrounds it.&nbsp; Ropes rich with bunting
were suspended between them and the statue, which was gaily
decked with flags.&nbsp; It was in this neighbourhood, and as you
went on <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>to Holyrood, that the ornaments were
of the richest character.&nbsp; Of the sixty designs submitted to
the committee, the preference was given to that of Mr. John
Steell, R.S.A., who was subsequently knighted by Her
Majesty.&nbsp; It was on the occasion of the great Volunteer
review in the Queen&rsquo;s Park, in 1861, that Prince Albert was
seen by the largest number of Scotch people; and it has evidently
been the aim of the artist to represent him as he was
then&mdash;in his uniform of field-marshal, with his cocked hat
in his right hand, while he holds the reins in his left.&nbsp;
The princely rank of the wearer is indicated by an order on the
left breast.&nbsp; In order that the representation might be as
perfect as possible, Her Majesty lent the artist the very uniform
worn on the occasion referred to.&nbsp; The modelling of the
busts was also done at Windsor Castle, under Royal
supervision.&nbsp; The horse was modelled from one lent by the
Duke of Buccleugh.&nbsp; On the pedestal are bas-reliefs
indicative of the character and pursuits of His Royal
Highness.&nbsp; On one side his marriage is represented; on
another his visit to the International Exhibition.&nbsp; Again we
see him peacefully happy at home in the bosom of his family; then
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>again as a rewarder of the merit he was ever anxious to
discover and befriend.&nbsp; In one part of the design are
quotations from the Prince&rsquo;s speeches, and classical
emblems; rank and wealth and talent, in all phases of society,
down to the very lowest, are represented as uniting to do honour
to the dead.&nbsp; In this varied work Mr. Steell was assisted,
at his own request, by Mr. William Brodie, Mr. Clark Stanton, and
the late Mr. MacCallum, whose unfinished work was completed by
Mr. Stevenson.&nbsp; The equestrian figure is upwards of fourteen
feet high, and weighs about eight tons.&nbsp; The pedestal is of
five blocks of Peterhead granite.&nbsp; According to a
contemporary, the Queen&rsquo;s emotion was manifest when the
statue was unveiled.&nbsp; The Scotch are a cautious people, and
are very slow in expressing an opinion on the memorial.&nbsp; All
I can say is, that I prefer it very much to that statue at the
commencement of the Holborn Viaduct, on which Mr. Meeking&rsquo;s
young men look down every day.</p>
<p>It was on the next day that you saw the statue and the
preparations to the most advantage, and such seemed to be the
opinion of all Edinburgh and the surrounding country.&nbsp; A
cloudless sky <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>and an Indian sun tinted everything
with gold, and a smart breeze set all the flags of the Venetian
masts waving all along the line in a way at once effective and
bewildering.&nbsp; Fashionable people filled up the streets,
dashing equipages drove rapidly past, shops were crammed, waiters
at the hotels were tired to death.&nbsp; I never saw so many
hungry Scots as I did at a celebrated restaurant, and a hungry
Scot is not a pleasant sight; and at the railway station I
question whether half the people got into their right carriages
after all.&nbsp; Porters and guards seemed alike confused; and
the people walked up and down the platform of the Waverley
Station as sheep without a shepherd.&nbsp; However, wearied and
hungry and bewildered as they were, they had had a day&rsquo;s
pleasure, and that was enough.</p>
<p>As for myself I took the Waverley route, and gliding past the
ruins of Craig Millar Castle&mdash;the prison-house of James the
Fifth, and the favourite residence of Queen Mary&mdash;and vainly
trying to catch a view of Abbotsford, of which one can see but
the waving woods, was gratified with a glimpse of Melrose, where
rests the heart of Bruce, which the Douglas had vainly striven to
carry to Palestine.&nbsp; All round me are <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>names and
places connected with border tradition and song.&nbsp; Dryburgh
Abbey is not far off, nor Hazeldean, nor Minto House.&nbsp;
Passing along the banks of the Teviot, by the frowning heights of
Rubertslaw on the left, I reach Hawick, whose history abounds in
heroic tale and legendary lore, although the present town is now
only known as an important and flourishing emporium of the
woollen manufactures.&nbsp; Passing up the vale of the Slitrig,
famous in legendary story, we come to Stobs Castle and Branxholme
House, celebrated in the &ldquo;Lay of the Last
Minstrel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close by is Hermitage Castle, founded by
Comyn, Earl of Monteith, where Lord de Soulis was boiled as a
reputed sorcerer at a Druidical spot, named the Nine Stane Rig,
at the head of the glen.&nbsp; At Kershope Foot the railway,
having passed through the land of the Armstrongs, renowned in
border warfare, enters England.&nbsp; Once more I am at home,
thankful to have seen so much of beauty and blessedness, of
wonders in heaven above, and on the earth beneath, and in the
waters underneath the earth; thankful also for improved health
and power of work acquired by yachting among the islands of the
Western Coast.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
